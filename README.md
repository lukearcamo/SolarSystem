# Solar System
During the winter break I binged all 6 seasons of The Expanse (it's really good btw).
I loved the attention to detail in the physics of the story and visuals.
However, I couldn't get an impression of the real vast *expanse* of the solar system, which is understandable otherwise the series would take years to watch.

So, I decided to turn this unhealthy activity into something productive.
I took orbital elements from NASA, mixed it with THREE.js, and made this.

Basically there are two main modes: a 3D map of the solar system, and a ship you can drive and is supposed to have gravity but I haven't fixed that yet because school is starting again and I am running out of time :(

This is *really really* unfinished and messy rn, it still even has messy comments everywhere, a list of features to add at the top, etc. I just wanted to make sure two weeks of work is backed up.
